A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a [Kigyō](https://t.me/kigyorobot) fork - Lynda has evolved further and was built to be more useful for Anime Chats. 

Can be found on telegram as [Lynda](https://t.me/LyndaRobot).

The Support group can be reached out to at [Eagle Union](https://t.me/YorktownEagleUnion), where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available. 

## Credits

This repo was just reamped to suit an Anime-centric community. All original credits go to Paul and his dedication, Without his efforts, this fork would not have been possible!
