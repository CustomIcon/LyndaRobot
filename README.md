A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a [Kigyō](https://t.me/kigyorobot) fork - Lynda has evolved further and was built to be more useful for Anime Chats. 

Can be found on telegram as [Lynda // Cyborg](https://t.me/LyndaRobot).

The Support group can be reached out to at [Eagle Union](https://t.me/YorktownEagleUnion), where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available.

 Note: [Eagle Union](https://t.me/YorktownEagleUnion) aims to handle support for [Lynda // Cyborg](https://t.me/LyndaRobot) and now how to setup your own fork, if you find this bit confusing/tough to understand then we recommend you ask a dev, kindly avoid asking how to setup the bot instance in the support chat, it aims to help our own instance of the bot. 
  
  ## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which are ordered by default in 3.6.



## How to setup on Heroku
