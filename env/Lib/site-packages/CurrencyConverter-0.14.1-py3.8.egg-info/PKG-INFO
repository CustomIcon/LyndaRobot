      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Description: .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexprengere/currencyconverter/master/logo/cc3.png
        
        This is a currency converter that uses historical rates against a reference currency (Euro).
        
        Currency data sources
        ---------------------
        
        The default source is the `European Central Bank <http://www.ecb.int/>`_. This is the ECB historical rates for 42 currencies against the Euro since 1999.
        It can be downloaded here: `eurofxref-hist.zip <http://www.ecb.int/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip>`_.
        The converter can use different sources as long as the format is the same.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install directly after cloning:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ python setup.py install --user
        
        Or use the Python package:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          $ pip install --user currencyconverter
        
        Command line tool
        -----------------
        
        After installation, you should have ``currency_converter`` in your ``$PATH``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ currency_converter 100 USD --to EUR
         100.000 USD = 87.512 EUR on 2016-05-06
        
        Python API
        ----------
        
        Create once the currency converter object:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from currency_converter import CurrencyConverter
            >>> c = CurrencyConverter()
        
        Convert from ``EUR`` to ``USD`` using the last available rate:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD') # doctest: +SKIP
            137.5...
        
        Default target currency is ``EUR``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR')
            100.0
            >>> c.convert(100, 'USD') # doctest: +SKIP
            72.67...
        
        You can change the date of the rate:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from datetime import date # datetime works too
            >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD', date=date(2013, 3, 21))
            129...
        
        Fallbacks
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Some rates are missing:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> c.convert(100, 'BGN', date=date(2010, 11, 21))
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            RateNotFoundError: BGN has no rate for 2010-11-21
        
        But we have a fallback mode for those, using a linear interpolation of the
        closest known rates, as long as you ask for a date within the currency date bounds:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> c = CurrencyConverter(fallback_on_missing_rate=True)
            >>> c.convert(100, 'BGN', date=date(2010, 11, 21))
            51.12...
        
        The fallback method can be configured with the ``fallback_on_missing_rate_method`` parameter, which currently supports ``"linear_interpolation"`` and ``"last_known"`` values.
        
        We also have a fallback mode for dates outside the currency bounds:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> c = CurrencyConverter()
            >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD', date=date(1986, 2, 2))
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            RateNotFoundError: 1986-02-02 not in USD bounds 1999-01-04/2016-04-29
            >>> 
            >>> c = CurrencyConverter(fallback_on_wrong_date=True)
            >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD', date=date(1986, 2, 2)) # fallback to 1999-01-04
            117.89...
        
        Other attributes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        + ``bounds`` lets you know the first and last available date for each currency
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> first_date, last_date = c.bounds['USD']
            >>> first_date
            datetime.date(1999, 1, 4)
            >>> last_date # doctest: +SKIP
            datetime.date(2016, 11, 14)
        
        + ``currencies`` is a set containing all available currencies
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> c.currencies # doctest: +SKIP
            set(['SGD', 'CAD', 'SEK', 'GBP', ...
            >>> 'AAA' in c.currencies
            False
            >>> c.convert(100, 'AAA')
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ValueError: AAA is not a supported currency
        
        Finally, you can use your own currency file, as long as it has the same format (ECB):
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Load the packaged data (might not be up to date)
            c = CurrencyConverter()
        
            # Load the up to date full history
            c = CurrencyConverter('http://www.ecb.int/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip')
        
            # Load only the latest rates (single day data source)
            c = CurrencyConverter('http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref.zip')
        
            # Load your custom file
            c = CurrencyConverter('./path/to/currency/file.csv')
        
        Decimal
        ~~~~~~~
        
        If you need exact conversions, you can use the ``decimal`` option to use ``decimal.Decimal`` internally when parsing rates.
        This will slow down the load time by a factor 10 though.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> c = CurrencyConverter(decimal=True)
            >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD', date=date(2013, 3, 21))
            Decimal('129.100')
